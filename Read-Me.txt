The BoidsFunctions.cpp and Timer.cpp files are referenced in the other files and do not need to be built.
Just have them in the same folder as BoidsOMP.cpp and BoidsMPI.cpp.
All the libraries used were built in c++ libraries from the current version of c++ used in GCC.

BoidsOMP must be built with G++ and BoidsMPI must be built with MPICPC

the OMP prgram takes arguments threads, number of boids and the MPI program only takes one argument for the number of boids.
